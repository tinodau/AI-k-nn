# AI-k-nn

This is example of code that i and my group are using for our big semester.

This code is using python 2 as programming language and KNN (K - nearest Neighbour) as algorithm

We were asked to process data 'trainset' as many as 90,000 lines of a material to process 'dataset' is, and then used to fill the 'testset' as many as 10,000 lines.

In the 'trainset' is given 10 data 'X' of each row and the first data is 'Y' as the output, of the whole 'trainset' is, we process them as a reference for gain accuracy precision in getting the value of 'Y'

after trainset is completed on the run, then we were asked to fill in 'testset' in which the value of 'Y' is unknown.
